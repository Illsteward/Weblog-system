# Multistage rendering

A simple server for serving html rendered from .md files via HTTP protocol.
Uses standard node.js library where possible, depending so far only on hbs and marked.

## Status

### Works
GETing views from .md files work with / for index.md, /filename for static file, /filename?{query} for rendering dynamic templates based on user input and /filename?id=id for getting article from database.   
Furthermore, if the requested path is not found, a 404.html file is provided from the views directory. Decided to go html for 404 in case something goes wrong with markdown parser.   
Added managing stylesheets with SASS preprocessor. Stylesheets are kept in separate styles folder inside views and compiled using node-sass module.   

### ToDo
1. Various models, hosted in separate project. Idealy will be swappable and provide the same interface (getEntries, getEntryByID) regardless of used database.
2. Partials. As in including various .md or HTML files on different parts of building the view or extending ViewControler.getView to allow making more robust views.
